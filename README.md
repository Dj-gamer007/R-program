# Basic Visualization with R

This repository contains a simple R script for visualizing the relationship between penguin flipper length and body mass using the `palmerpenguins` dataset and the `ggplot2` library.

## Description

The script demonstrates basic data visualization techniques in R by creating a scatter plot. It uses the `palmerpenguins` dataset, which is a great alternative to the Iris dataset for learning data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have R installed on your machine. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Installation

The script requires the following R packages:

- `palmerpenguins`
- `ggplot2`

You can install these packages using the following commands in R:

```r
install.packages('palmerpenguins')
install.packages('ggplot2')
